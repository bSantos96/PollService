# PollService
## Setup
1. Run the PollService.Database
2. Fill the MailSetting.settings.json file to use the Share Endpoint
   
   2.1 You can use the https://ethereal.email/create to create an SMTP server to send the emails. It's pretty intuitive to use 😁
3. To test the endpoints, I've attached a Postman collection that you can use.
4. Open the Microservice.Poll.sln on Visual Studio, build and run.
5. Now, you should be able to use the microservice.
